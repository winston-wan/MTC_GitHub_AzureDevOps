# OSS PaaS and DevOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution for integrating and deploying complex open-source software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. You will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure Web App for Containers, migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, enhance application functionality using serverless technologies, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to migrate and deploy OSS applications into Azure PaaS using modern DevOps methodologies and Docker containers.

## Overview

Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They have a MERN stack web application which they host on-premises and are looking to migrate their OSS application into Azure. They will be creating a custom Docker image for their application and using a Jenkins continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy the application into a Web App for Containers instance. In addition, they will be swapping out the use of MongoDB with Azure Cosmos DB, using the MongoDB APIs.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist them with completing the OSS application and database migrations into Azure. You will create a custom Docker image, provision an Azure Container Registry, push the image to the registry, and configure the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to a Web App for Containers instance. You will also help them implement functionality enhancements using serverless architecture services in Azure.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This diagram consists of icons that are connected by arrows. On the left, the Developer icon (VS Code) points in a linear fashion to the GitHub Repo and Jenkins icons. The previous two icons are enclosed in a box labeled CI/CD Pipeline. Jenkins points to Web App for Containers on the right. Various arrows point from Web App for Container to: Azure Container Registry (a double-sided arrow); Logic Apps (a linear arrow that also points from Logic Apps to Customers); Customers (a linear arrow); and Azure Cosmos DB (a double-sided arrow that also points from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Functions with another double-sided arrow).](media/solution-architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

The solution begins with developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their code editor, so they can leverage its rich integration with GitHub, Docker, and Azure. From a high level, developers will package the entire OSS application inside a custom Docker container using the Docker extension in VS Code. The image will be pushed to an Azure Container Registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub and Jenkins. This Docker image will then be deployed to a Web App for Containers instance, as part of their continuous delivery process using The Azure App Service Jenkins plugin.

The MongoDB database will be imported into Azure Cosmos DB, using mongoimport.exe, and access the database from the application will continue to use the MongoDB APIs. The database connection string in the application will be updated to point to the new Cosmos DB.

Serverless architecture will be applied to order processing and customer notifications. Azure Functions will be used to automate the processing of orders. Logic Apps will be applied to send SMS notifications, via a Twilio connector, to customers informing them that their order has been processed and shipped.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN
    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.
2. Linux virtual machine configured with:
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Azure CLI
    - Docker
    - Node.js and npm
    - MongoDB Community Edition

## Exercise 1: Run starter application

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a local copy of the starter application on your Lab VM, add some sample data to the local MongoDB database, and run the application.

### Task 1: Connect to your Lab VM

In this task, you will create an RDP connection to your Lab VM. If you are already connected, skip to [Task 2](#task-2-grant-permissions-to-docker).

1. Navigate to the Azure portal and select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, then select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list. If there are too many, enter "hands-on-lab" into the filter box to reduce the resource groups displayed the list.

    ![Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal. On the Resource groups blade, hands-on-lab is highlighted in the filter box, and hands-on-lab is highlighted in the search results.](media/azure-resource-groups.png "Azure Portal")

2. Next, select **LabVM** from the list of available resources.

    ![LabVM is highlighted in the list of available resources.](media/rg-labvm.png "Select LabVM")

3. On the **LabVM** blade, copy the Public IP address from the Essentials area on the Overview screen.

    ![Public IP address is highlighted in the top menu on the LabVM blade.](media/labvm-public-ip-address.png "LabVM blade")

4. Open a Remote Desktop Client (RDP) application and enter or paste the Public IP address of your Lab VM into the computer name field.

5. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

6. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Remote Desktop Connection prompt about connecting to the remote despite the identity of the remote computer being unverified. Yes is selected.](media/remote-desktop-connection.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog box")

7. Enter the following credentials (or the non-default credentials if you changed them):

    - **User name:** demouser
    - **Password:** Password.1!!

    ![The credentials above are entered in the Login to xrdp dialog box.](media/login-to-xrdp.png "Login to xrdp dialog box")

8. Select **OK** to log into the Lab VM.

### Task 2: Grant permissions to Docker

In this task, you will grant permissions to the demouser account to access the Unix socket needed to communicate with the Docker engine.

1. On your Lab VM, open a **Bash** shell by selecting the Start menu, and then expanding Debian, Applications, and Shells.

    ![In the Lab VM start menu, Debian -> Applications -> Shells is expanded, and Bash is highlighted in the Shells menu.](media/labvm-menu-bash-shell.png "Start menu")

2. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
    ```

3. After running the command, you will need **completely log out of the Lab VM** and log back in (if in doubt, reboot).

4. After logging back in, run the following command to test that the demouser account has proper permissions:

    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the bash shell command sudo usermod -a pG docker \$USER output. Includes output from running the test command, docker run hello-world.](media/bash-docker-hello-world.png "Bash Shell")

### Task 3: Integrate GitHub into VS Code

In this task, you will install the GitHub extension in VS Code, and configure a service integration with your GitHub account. This integration will allow you to push your code changes to GitHub directly from VS Code.

1. On your Lab VM, open **VS Code** under Programming on the Start menu.

    ![Visual Studio Code is highlighted under Programming on the start menu.](media/labvm-menu-programming-vscode.png "Visual Studio Code")

    ![The Personal access token is pasted in the box.](media/github-paste-personal-access-token.png "Paste the Personal access token")

18. VS Code is now connected to your GitHub account.

19. Close VS Code.

### Task 4: Clone the starter application

In this task, you will clone the starter application, creating a local copy on your Lab VM.

1. On your Lab VM, open a browser, and navigate to your GitHub account (<https://github.com>).

2. Within your GitHub account, navigate to the forked copy of the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` application page, select **Clone or download**, then select the **copy** link next to the web URL.

    ![The Clone or download button is selected on the forked copy of the MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps application page, and the web URL is displayed below it.](media/github-clone.png "Select Clone or download")

3. Open a new bash shell, and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

4. Next, enter the following command, replacing `[EMAIL]` with the email address you used when creating your GitHub account. This will associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM.

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "[EMAIL]"
    ```

    ![The above command to associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-git-config.png "bash terminal window")

5. At the prompt, enter the following command, replacing `[CLONE-URL]` with URL you copied from GitHub in step 2 above:

    ```bash
    git clone [CLONE-URL]
    ```

    ![The git clone command is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-git-clone.png "bash terminal window")

    ```

    ![The command to change the directory is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-cd-mcw-oss-paas-and-devops.png "bash terminal window")

7. Finally, issue a command to open the starter project in VS Code by typing:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

8. A new VS Code window will open, with the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` folder opened.

    ![The MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps folder is open in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the Welcome pane is open on the right.](media/vscode-mcw-oss-paas-and-devops.png "Visual Studio Code window")

9. You are now ready to begin working with the project in VS Code.

### Task 5: Launch the starter application

In this task, you will seed the MongoDB with sample data, then run the application locally, connected to your MongoDB instance. This task is to verify the connection to MongoDB and that it contains the seeded plan data, before we migrate the application and data to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Return to VS Code, select **Terminal** from the menu, and select **New Terminal**.

    ![New Terminal is highlighted in the Terminal menu in Visual Studio Code.](media/vscode-terminal-menu.png "Visual Studio Code Terminal menu")

2. This will open a new bash terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code dialog.

3. Change directories to the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder by running the following command. **Important**: Be sure to include the quotes around the path, since it contains a space.

    ```bash
    cd "Hands-on lab/lab-files"
    ```

4. At the bash prompt, use the `npm install` command to ensure the required components are installed on your Lab VM.

    ```bash
    sudo npm install
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The command above is entered at the command prompt, and the results of the command are displayed.](media/vscode-terminal-npm-install.png "Bash terminal window")

5. Next, enter the following to seed the local MongoDB database with plans, user accounts, and orders.

    ```bash
    node data/Seed.js
    ```

    ![The above command to seed the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-seedjs.png "Bash terminal window")

    >**Note**: If you receive an error that the service is not running, start the MongoDB service by executing the `sudo service mongod start` command at the shell prompt.

6. Next, build the application using the following:

    ```bash
    sudo npm run build
    ```

7. Finally, enter the following to start the web server for the application. You will see a `connection successful` message in the terminal window.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

8. Open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to view the landing page of the starter application. You will see three plans listed on the application home page, which are pulled from the local MongoDB database.

    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](media/bfyo-web-home.png "View the three plans")

9. Return to the VS Code integrated terminal window, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to Cosmos DB

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will provision an Azure Cosmos DB account, and then update the starter application's database connection string to point to your new Azure Cosmos DB account. You will then, use `mongoimport.exe` to migrate the data in your MongoDB database into Cosmos DB collections, and verify with the application that you are connected to your Cosmos DB database.

### Task 1: Provision Cosmos DB using the MongoDB API

In this task, you will provision a new Azure Cosmos DB account using the MongoDB API.

1. In the Azure portal, select **+Create a resource**, **Databases**, the select **Azure Cosmos DB**.

    ![+ Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, and Databases and Azure Cosmos DB are highlighted on the New blade.](media/create-resource-cosmos-db.png "Azure Portal")

2. On the **Azure Cosmos** **DB** blade, enter the following:

    **PROJECT DETAILS**:

    - **Subscription:** Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource Group:** Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group you created previously.

    **INSTANCE DETAILS**:

    - **Account Name**: Enter `best-for-you-db-SUFFIX`, where SUFFIX is your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the name is unique (indicated by a green check mark).
    - **API:** Select **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API**.
    - **Location:** Select a location near you from the list (Note: not all locations are available for Cosmos DB).
    - **Enable geo-redundancy:** Select Disable.
    - **Multi-region Writes**: Select Disable.

    ![The information above is entered in the Azure Cosmos DB blade.](media/cosmos-db-create-basics.png "Azure Cosmos DB")

3. Select **Review + create** to move to the validation step.

4. Ensure the **Validation Success** message is displayed, and then select **Create** to provision the new Azure Cosmos DB.

### Task 2: Create and scale collections

In this task, you will create the collections needed for your database migration and increase each collection's throughput from the default 1,000 RUs to 2,500 RUs. This is done to avoid throttling during the migration, and reduce the time required to import data.

> To learn more about RUs and throughput provisioning in Cosmos DB, read [Request Units in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/request-units).

1. When your Cosmos DB account is provisioned, navigate to it in the Azure portal, select **Browse** from the left-hand menu, under **Collections**, and then select **+Add Collection**.

    ![Browse is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu of your Azure Cosmos DB account, and + Add Collection is highlighted on the right.](media/cosmos-db-add-collection.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

2. In the **Add Collection** dialog, enter the following:

    - **Database id:** Select **Create new**, and enter **best-for-you-organics**.
    - **Collection Id:** Enter **orders**.
    - **Storage capacity:** Select **Fixed (10 GB)**.
    - **Throughput:** Enter **2500**.
    - Select **OK** to create the collection.

    ![The information above is entered in the Add Collection dialog box.](media/cosmos-db-new-collection-orders.png "Add Collection dialog box")

3. On the Collections blade, select **New Collection** to create another collection.

    ![The New Collection button is highlighted on the Cosmos DB Collections blade.](media/cosmos-db-new-collection.png "New Collection")

4. On the Add Collection dialog, enter the following:

    - **Database id**: Select **Use existing** and select the **best-for-you-organics** database from the list.
    - **Collection id**: Enter **users**.
    - **Storage capacity**: Select **Fixed (10 GB)**.
    - **Throughput**: Enter **2500**.
    - Select **OK** to create the collection.

    ![The information for the users collections above is entered into the Add Collection dialog.](media/cosmos-db-new-collection-users.png "Add Collection")

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, this time entering **plans** as the collection name.

6. The best-for-you-organics database will have three collections listed under it when you are complete.

    ![The best-for-you-organics database is displayed, with orders, plans, and users collections under it.](media/cosmos-db-database-and-collections.png "Cosmos DB Collections")

### Task 3: Update database connection string

In this task, you will retrieve the connection string for your Azure Cosmos DB database and update the starter application's database connection string.

1. On the **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade, select **Connection String** under **Settings** in the left-hand menu, and copy the **PRIMARY connection string**.

    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade, and the Primary Connection String value is highlighted on the Read-write Keys tab on the right.](media/cosmos-db-connection-strings.png "Azure cosmos DB account blade")

2. Return to VS Code.

3. Open `app.js` from the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` directory of the application and locate the line that starts with **var databaseUrl** (line 16).

    ![App.js is selected and highlighted in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the line starting with var databaseUrl is highlighted on the right.](media/vscode-app-js-database-url.png "Visual Studio Code window")

4. Replace the value of the **databaseUrl** variable with the Cosmos DB connection string you copied from the Azure portal.

    ![The value of the databaseUrl variable is displayed in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-app-js-connection-string.png "Visual Studio Code window")

5. The connection string copied from the portal does not specify the name of the database, so you now need to add that to the connection string. Scroll to the end of the value you just pasted in and locate **10255/?ssl=** in the string.

    ![10255/?ssl= is highlighted in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-app-js-connection-string-database-name-position.png "Visual Studio Code window")

6. Between the "/" and the "?" insert **best-for-you-organics** to specify the database name.

    ![best-for-you-organics is selected in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-app-js-connection-string-database-name.png "Visual Studio Code window")

7. Save `app.js`.

8. In the VS Code integrated terminal, enter the following command to rebuild the application:

    ```bash
    sudo npm run build
    ```

9. When the build completes, start the application by typing the following:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

10. Return to your browser and refresh the application page. Note: You may need to press **CTRL+F5** in your browser window to clear the browser cache while refreshing the page.

    ![This is a screenshot of the refreshed application page.](media/bfyo-web-home-empty.png "Refreshed application screenshot")

    > Notice the three plans that were displayed on the page previously are no longer there. This is because the application is now pointed to your Azure Cosmos DB, and the plans collection does not contain any data yet.

11. Let's move on to copying the data from the local MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB.

### Task 4: Import data to the API for MongoDB using mongoimport

In this task, you will use `mongoimport.exe` to import data to your Cosmos DB account. There is a shell script located in the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` project which handles exporting the data out of your MongoDB into JSON files on the local file system. These files will be used for the import into Cosmos DB.

1. On your Lab VM, open a new integrated bash prompt in VS Code by selecting the **+** next to the shell dropdown in the integrated terminal pane.

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The + button is highlighted.](media/vscode-terminal-new.png "Bash terminal window")

2. At the prompt, enter the following command to grant execute permissions on the export script:

    ```bash
    chmod +x "Hands-on lab/lab-files/data/mongo-export.sh"
    ```

3. Next, run the script by entering the following command:

    ```bash
    "Hands-on lab/lab-files/data/mongo-export.sh"
    ```

    ![The above command to export data from the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-mongo-export.png "Bash terminal window")

4. The script creates the folder ~/MongoExport, and exports each of the collections in your MongoDB to JSON files. Navigate to the MongoExport directory for your user account by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cd ~/MongoExport
    ```

5. You are now ready to import the data into Azure Cosmos DB using `mongoimport.exe`.

6. You will use the following command template for executing the data import:

    ```bash
    mongoimport --host <your_hostname>:10255 -u <your_username> -p <your_password> --db <your_database> --collection <your_collection> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file <your_collection>.json
    ```

7. To get the values needed for the template command above, return to the **Connection string** blade for your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal. Leave this window up, as you will need the **HOST**, **USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values from this page to import data to your Cosmos DB account.

    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Read-write Keys tab on the right, the values under Host, Username, and Primary Password are highlighted.](media/cosmos-db-connection-strings-values.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

8. Replace the values as follows in the template command above:

    - `<your_hostname>`: Copy and paste the **Host** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade.
    - `<your_username>`: Copy and paste the **Username** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade.
    - `<your_password>`: Copy and paste the **Primary Password** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection** **String** blade.
    - `<your_database>`: Enter "best-for-you-organics".
    - `<your_collection>`: Enter "plans" (Note there are two instances of `<your-collection>` in the template command).

9. Your final command should look something like:

    ```bash
    mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection plans --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file plans.json
    ```

10. Copy and paste the final command at the command prompt to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The final command to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB is displayed in the Command Prompt window.](media/vscode-terminal-mongoimport.png "Bash terminal window")

    > You will see a message indicating the number of documents imported, which should be 3 for plans.

11. Verify the import by selecting **Data Explorer** in your Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal, expanding plans, and selecting **Documents**. You will see the three documents imported listed.

    ![Data Explorer is selected and highlighted on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Collections blade, the turned delta next to plans is highlighted, and Documents is selected and highlighted below it. On the Mongo Documents tab to the right, the first of three imported documents is selected and highlighted.](media/cosmos-db-plans-documents.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

12. Repeat step 8 for the users and orders collections, replacing the `<your_collection>` values with:

    - users

        ```bash
        mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection users --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file users.json
        ```

    - orders

        ```bash
        mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection orders --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file orders.json
        ```

13. To verify the starter application is now pulling properly from Azure Cosmos DB, return to your browser running the starter application (<http://localhost:3000>), and refresh the page. You should now see the three plans appear again on the home page. These were pulled from your Azure Cosmos DB database.

    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](media/bfyo-web-home.png "View the three plans")

14. You have successfully migrated the application and data to use Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB APIs.

15. Return to the Integrated terminal window of VS Code which is running the application, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

### Task 5: Install Azure Cosmos DB extension for VS Code

In this task, you will install the Azure Cosmos DB extension for VS Code to take advantage of the integration with Azure Cosmos DB. This extension allows you to view and interact with your Cosmos DB databases, collections, and documents directly from VS Code.

1. Select the **Extensions** icon, enter "azure cosmos db" into the search box, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** extension, and then select **Install** in the Extension: Azure Cosmos DB window.

    ![The Extensions icon is highlighted on the left side of the Extension: Azure Cosmos DB window. On the right, azure cosmos db is in the search box, Azure Cosmos DB is highlighted below it, and Install is highlighted on the right side.](media/vscode-extensions-cosmosdb.png "Install the Azure Cosmos DB extension")

2. In the left-hand menu of VS Code you should now see an Azure icon. Select that, and then select **Sign in to Azure**.

    ![Sign in to Azure is highlighted below AZURE COSMOS DB in the bottom left-hand corner of Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-azure-sign-in.png "Sign in to Azure")

    > If you don't see the Azure icon, restart VS Code, and reopen the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` project folder.

3. Enter your Azure account credentials in the browser window that appears.

4. If presented with a prompt to enter a password for a new keyring, enter "**Password.1!!**" as the password, and select **Continue**.

    ![Choose password for new keyring dialog, with Password.1!! entered in the password and confirm boxes.](media/ubuntu-new-keyring.png "Choose password window")

5. Once you have signed in, you will receive a message that you can close the browser window.

6. Back in VS Code, you should now see your Azure account listed under Azure Cosmos DB, along with your Azure account email listed in the status bar of VS Code.

    ![Your Azure account is listed under Azure Cosmos DB, and your Azure email is listed in the status bar of the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-azure-cosmosdb.png "Azure Cosmos DB window")

7. From here, you can view your databases, collections, and documents, as well as edit documents directly in VS Code, and push the updated documents back into your database.

### Task 6: Decrease collection throughput

In this task, you will decrease the throughput on your collections. Azure Cosmos DB uses an hourly billing rate, so reducing the throughput after the data migration will help save costs.

1. From the Azure Cosmos DB menu pane in Visual Studio Code, right-click on the **best-for-you-db** database and then select **Open in Portal**.

    ![Open in Portal is highlighted in the best-for-you-db content menu.](media/vscode-azure-cosmosdb-open-in-portal.png "Cosmos DB")

3. Expand the **orders** collection and select **Scale & Settings**.

4. Change the **Throughput** value to **400** and select **Save**.

    ![Scale is selected and highlighted on the left side of the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Collections blade, Scale & Settings is selected and highlighted below orders. On the Scale & Settings tab to the right, 400 is entered and highlighted in the Throughput box, and the Save icon is highlighted above it.](media/cosmos-db-scale.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 for the **plans** and **users** collections.

## Exercise 3: Containerize the app

Duration: 30 minutes

This exercise walks you through containerizing the existing Best For You Organics Company MERN application using Docker, pushing the image to an **Azure Container Registry**, then deploying the image to **Web App for Containers** directly from VS Code.

### Task 1: Create an Azure Container Registry

In this task, you will be creating a private Docker registry in the Azure portal, so you have a place to store the custom Docker image you will create in later steps.

1. In the Azure portal, select **+Create a resource**, **Containers**, and select **Container Registry**.

    ![+ Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, Containers is selected and highlighted in the middle, and  Container Registry is highlighted on the right.](media/create-container-registry-resource.png "Azure Portal")

2. On the **Create container registry** blade, enter the following:

    - **Registry name:** Enter "bestforyouregistrySUFFIX," where SUFFIX is your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the name is unique (indicated by a green check mark).
    - **Subscription:** Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group:** Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group created previously.
    - **Location:** Select the location you are using for resources in this hands-on lab.
    - **Admin user:** Select **Enable**.
    - **SKU:** Select **Basic**.

    ![The information above is entered on the Create container registry blade.](media/azure-create-resource-container-registry.png "Create container registry blade")

3. Select **Create** to provision the new Azure Container Registry.

### Task 2: Install Docker extension in VS Code

The Docker extension for VS Code is used to simplify the management of local Docker images and commands, as well as the deployment of a built app image to Azure.

1. On your Lab VM, return to VS Code, and the open `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` starter project.

2. Select the **Extensions icon** from the left-hand menu, enter "docker" into the search box, select the **Docker** extension, and in the **Extension: Docker** window, and then select **Install**.

    ![Extensions is highlighted in the Visual Studio Code navigation pane, docker is entered in the Extensions search box, Docker is highlighted below, and Install is highlighted on the right.](media/vscode-extensions-docker.png "Visual Studio Code window")

3. You should now see a Docker icon appear in the left-hand menu of Visual Studio Code. Select the **Docker** icon. Expand **Registries** and then expand **Azure**. You should see the **bestforyouregistry** you created above listed.

    ![In the Docker VS Code extension, Registries and Azure are expanded, and the bestforyouregistry is highlighted.](media/vscode-extension-docker-registries.png "Docker extension")

    > If you don't see the Docker icon in the left-hand menu, close and reopen VS Code, and the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` project.

### Task 3: Create Docker image and run the app

In this task, you will use VS Code, and the Docker extension, to add the necessary files to the project to create a custom Docker image for the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` app.

1. On your Lab VM, return to VS Code, and the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` project.

2. Open the VS Code Command Palette, by selecting **View** from the menu, then **Command Palette**.

3. Enter "add docker" into the Command Palette and select **Docker: Add docker files to workspace**.

    ![Docker: Add docker files to workspace is selected under add docker in the Command Palette.](media/vscode-command-palette-add-docker.png "Select Docker: Add docker files to workspace")

    ![3000 is selected in the field above What port does your app listen on?](media/vscode-command-palette-docker-port.png "Explorer")

6. This will add Dockerfile, along with several configuration files for Docker compose to the project.

    ![Dockerfile and several configuration files are highlighted in the Explorer pane.](media/vscode-docker-files.png "Explorer pane")

7. Select **Dockerfile** from the file navigator and observe the contents. This file provides the commands required to assemble a Docker image for the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` application.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Dockerfile contents. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/vscode-docker-file.png "Dockerfile screenshot")

8. Currently, the Docker extension for Visual Studio Code places the generated Docker files in the root directory of the project. Because the project files are all located in the `lab-files` directory, we need to move the generated files into that folder. Select the `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.debug.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `Dockerfile` files, and then drag and drop them into the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder. Respond Yes if prompted about moving the files.

    ![The docker files specified above are highlighted within the Hands-on lab/lab-files folder.](media/vscode-docker-move-files.png "Visual Studio Code files")

9. Next, you will tell Docker to build and image for your app. Select the **Terminal** menu in Visual Studio Code, and then select **New Terminal**.

    ![New Terminal is highlighted in the Terminal menu in Visual Studio Code.](media/vscode-terminal-menu.png "Visual Studio Code Terminal menu")

10. In the new terminal window, change the directory to the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    cd "Hands-on lab/lab-files"
    ```

11. With the next command you will provide a **registry**, **image name**, and **tag**, using the following format. This format will allow the image to be pushed to your container registry.

    > `[registry]/[image name]:[tag]`

12. For this, you will need the Login server value from your Azure Container registry's **Access keys** blade.

    ![Access keys is selected under Settings on the Azure Container registry's Access keys blade, and on the right, bestforyouregistry.azurecr.io is highlighted in the Login server box on the right.](media/acr-login-server.png "Container registry blade")

13. At the terminal prompt, enter the following, where `[Login server]` is the Login server value from Azure:

    ```bash
    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t [Login server]/best-for-you-organics:latest .
    ```

    > Be sure to include the "." at the end of the line.

14. For example:

    ```bash
    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t bestforyouregistry.azurecr.io/best-for-you-organics:latest .
    ```

15. Press **Enter**, which will trigger the build of the image. You will see the following output in the terminal window:

    ![The docker build command above is entered into the VS Code terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-build.png "Docker build")

    ![The committed changes are displayed on the build page.](media/jenkins-build-history-details.png "Build page")

9. You have successfully set up your CI pipeline.

### Task 5: Install Docker on the Jenkins VM

In this task, you will install Docker CE on your Jenkins VM, so it can be used to build images from the build artifacts produced by your CI build.

1. The first step is to ensure no older versions of Docker are installed on your Jenkins VM. Using the SSH tunnel bash terminal you opened previously, navigate to the command prompt, and enter:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
    ```

2. Next, you need to set up a Docker repository on the host machine. The begin, update the `apt` package index:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. Install the necessary packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
    ```

4. Add Docker's official GPG key.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

5. Verify that you now have the key with fingerprint `9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88`, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
    ```

6. You should see output similar to:

    ```bash
    pub   4096R/0EBFCD88 2017-02-22
        Key fingerprint = 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
    uid                  Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
    sub   4096R/F273FCD8 2017-02-22
    ```

7. Next, enter the following commands to set up the **stable** repository.

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository \
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) \
    stable"
    ```

8. You are now ready to install Docker CE. Start by updating the `apt` package index.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

9. Install the latest version of Docker CE, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce
    ```

10. Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the `hello-world` image.

    ```bash
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

    ![Hello world message from Docker on the Jenkins server.](media/bash-jenkins-docker-hello-world.png "Jenkins Docker install")

11. The final step is to add permission to the `jenkins` user to Docker.

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
    sudo chmod 664 /run/docker.sock
    ```

12. Now, restart the Jenkins service, entering the jenkinsadmin password, `Password.1!!`, when prompted.

    ```bash
    service jenkins restart
    ```

### Task 6: Add an Azure service principal for Jenkins

In this task, you will use the Azure CLI to create an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application and service principal (SP) that will provide the Jenkins CD pipeline access to Azure resources. You will grant the SP permissions to the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the **Cloud Shell** icon in the top toolbar.

    ![The Cloud Shell icon is highlighted on the Azure toolbar.](media/azure-toolbar-cloud-shell.png "Azure Toolbar")

2. Select **PowerShell** in the Cloud Shell pane.

    ![PowerShell is highlighted in the Cloud Shell pane.](media/cloud-shell-powershell.png "Cloud Shell")

3. Next, you will issue a command to create a service principal named **best-for-you-app** and assign it contributor permissions to your **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group. The command will be in the following format:

    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "best-for-you-app" --role contributor --scopes subscriptions/{SubID}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroupName}
    ```

    > You will need to replace the `{SubID}` and `{ResourceGroupName}` values.

4. To retrieve the values you need to replace above, navigate to **Resource groups** in the Azure navigation menu, enter "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" into the filter box, and select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the list.

5. On your hands-on-lab-SUFFIX blade, you will copy two values to paste into the command above:

    - **Resource group name**: Copy the resource group name (hands-on-lab-SUFFIX) and paste it into the command in place of `{ResourceGroupName}`.
    - **Subscription ID**: In the Essentials area of the Overview blade, locate the Subscription ID, then copy and paste the value into the command in place of the `{SubID}` value.

    ![On the Overview blade of the resource group, Subscription ID is highlighted.](media/resource-group-overview-subscription-id.png "Resource group overview blade")

6. Copy and paste the updated `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command at the Cloud Shell prompt and press `Enter`. The command should be similar to the following, with your subscription ID and resource group name:

    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "best-for-you-app" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/30fc406c-c745-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/hands-on-lab
    ```

    ![The az ad sp create-for-rbac command is entered into the Cloud Shell, and the output of the command is displayed.](media/azure-cli-create-sp.png "Azure CLI")

7. Copy the output from the command into a text editor, as you will need it in the next task. The output should be similar to:

    ```json
    {
        "appId": "24c91e7d-4568-4f48-bca5-af3fc75e5481",
        "displayName": "best-for-you-app",
        "name": "http://best-for-you-app",
        "password": "389bbb6f-731a-449a-a438-65a0f485ec8b",
        "tenant": "9c37bff0-cd20-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```

8. To verify the role assignment, select **Access control (IAM)** from the left-hand menu of the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group blade, and then select the **Role assignments** tab and locate **best-for-you-app** under the CONTRIBUTOR role.

    ![The Role assignments tab is displayed, with best-for-you-app highlighted under CONTRIBUTOR in the list.](media/rg-hands-on-lab-role-assignments.png "Role assignments")

### Task 7: Add continuous delivery to Jenkins build job

In this task, you will use the [Azure App Service Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-app-service) to add continuous deployment (CD) to the Jenkins build pipeline. This will use a post-build action to create a new Docker image from the build, push that image to your Azure Container Registry, and deploy the image to your Web App for Containers instance. This post-build action will run under the credentials of the SP you created in the previous task.

1. Return to your **Jenkins** dashboard, and select the **best-for-you-build** project.

    ![The best-for-you-build project is highlighted on the Jenkins dashboard.](media/jenkins-dashboard-best-for-you-build.png "Jenkins dashboard")

9. Select **Save**.

### Task 8: Trigger CI-CD pipeline

In this task, you will commit changes to the `MTC_GitHub_AzureDevOps` starter application and trigger the full CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins, resulting in the updated application being added to a new Docker image, pushed to ACR, and deployed to Web App for Containers.

1. Return to VS Code on your Lab VM, open the `.dockerignore` file, and delete the line containing __DockerFile*__ from the file. This will allow Jenkins to use the file to build the container in the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

2. Next, open the `src/components/plan/Plans.js` file, and insert the following markup between `<div class="container">` and `<Grid>`:

    ```html
    <h3>Welcome to Best For You Organics Company</h3>
    ```

    ![The src/components/plan/Plans.js file is highlighted on the left side of Visual Studio Code, and the markup above is highlighted on the right.](media/vscode-plans-js.png "VS Code")

3. Save the updated files.

4. As you did in [Task 4](#task-4-trigger-ci-build), above, select the **Source Control icon** from the left-hand menu, enter a commit comment, select **+** to stage the change, and select the **checkmark** to commit the change, and push to GitHub. Enter your credentials if prompted. This will trigger the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

    ![The updated files are listed under Staged Changes in VS Code, and a commit comment is entered.](media/visual-studio-code-cd-file-updates-commit.png "Visual Studio Code")

5. Return to your Jenkins dashboard, and select the **best-for-you-build** project, and select the latest build number under Build History.

    ![The Jenkins build history is displayed, with a progress bar next to #2](media/jenkins-build-history.png "Jenkins build history")

6. On the Build page, select **Console Output** from the left-hand menu.

    ![Console Output is highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Jenkins project build page](media/jenkins-build-console-output.png "Build console output")

7. On the Console Output page, you can monitor the build progress. When it completes after a few minutes, you will see a SUCCESS message similar to the following:

    ![A build and Docker deployment success message is displayed in the console output in Jenkins](media/jenkins-build-console-output-success.png "Build and Docker deployment success")

8. When the deployment is complete, you can verify the changes deployed successfully by navigating to your App Service instance in the Azure portal, and selecting the URL on the overview blade. The deployment of the container can take several minutes to complete so refreshes may take a few minutes to show the new header.

    >**Tip**: It may help to open the app in an Incognito or InPrivate browser window, so you don't have the old page cached.

9. You should see the home page, with a new header above the three plans on the page.

    ![Welcome to Best for You Organics Company! is highlighted above the Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes in this screenshot of the home page.](media/bfyo-web-welcome.png "Home page")

## Exercise 6: Create Azure Function for order processing
